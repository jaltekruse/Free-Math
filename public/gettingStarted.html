            <h3>General Instructions for Any LMS</h3>
            <p>Free Math is easy to set up, all you need is a standard LMS that can collect files.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Assign problems to your students.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>You can simply give them a list of problems from your textbook or a
                            worksheet. Students can start with a blank Free Math document, copying
                            down and working through problems just as if they were completing work in
                            paper notebooks.</li>
                        <li>
                            If you are interested in authoring your own assignment, you can optionally
                            use the student assignment editor to create a list of problems and directions
                            for your students. From there you can share the file with your students
                            through your LMS, which they can then use as a template for their own
                            assignment files.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                <li>Students complete digital work, save it as a file and submit it through your LMS.</li>
                <li>You download the files in bulk from your LMS as a zip file
                    (<a href="#lmsIntegration">LMS specifc instructions linked below</a>).</li>
                <li>Load the zip file into Free Math for grading, the app will show you
                    where students struggled the most.
                    Anything you donâ€™t have time to grade gets completion points.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                        There is no need to prepare anything ahead of grading; rather than rely on a
                        rigid answer key, all of the unique answers provided by students will be shown
                        in groups which can be graded in bulk. </li>
                        <li>It is useful to have an answer key that
                        you can reference while grading, but you do not need to type this into Free Math.
                        This flexible system accommodates the fact that several of the groups may be
                        different formats of the correct answer, and others may deserve partial credit.</li>
                        <li>You simply need to provide a score to each unique final answer and give specific
                        feedback to students who need it.</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>Save the grading feedback, which generates a zip file filled with
                    individual graded documents for each student.</li>
                <li>Upload the zip file full of documents into your LMS, it will provide the
                    individual graded documents to each student.</li>
                <li>Record the overall grades into your grade book. We are still working on direct integration
                    with LMS gradebooks, so for now you need to copy the scores over yourself manually while
                    viewing them in the grading experience.</li>
            </ol>

                    Instructions for Specific LMS Tools
                </h2>
                <p> LMS products come with features for collecting documents
                    from students and managing them in bulk. These features
                    are often used for grading files like papers or presentations.
                    These types of files must be examined individually for
                    grading. One great advantage of Free Math is that all
                    documents are graded together, with optimized actions for
                    grading similar work.</p>
                    <p> Here are some links to instructions for managing student files
                        in specific LMS products. As Free Math natively opens
                        and saves zip files, you can often avoid steps related
                        to unzipping downloaded documents and manually creating
                        a new zip of the graded documents when re-uploading.
                        Keep this in mind as you follow these instructions.
