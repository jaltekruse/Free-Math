            <h2>Using Free Math with Google Classroom</h2>
                <br />
                <br />
                On your class homepage, click on an assignment where students have
                uploaded Free Math files as their submissions.
                <br />
                <br />
                <img src="images/googleClassroom/image8.png" width="100%" />
                <br />
                <br />
                <br />

                On the page with all of their assignments listed, click on the folder
                icon to bring you to the Google Drive folder that contains all of your
                students submissions.
                <br />
                <br />
                <img src="images/googleClassroom/image2.png" width="100%" />
                <br />
                <br />
                <br />

                Click on the arrow for the dropdown menu on the Google Drive folder.
                <br />
                <br />
                <img src="images/googleClassroom/image3.png" width="100%" />
                <br />
                <br />
                <br />

                Select "Download" to get a zip file full of all the assignments. It will
                take a little bit for google to generate the zip file, for a typical class
                under 30 students it should be less than a minute, but this scales up as you
                have more files. If it shows a popup warning that you are going to leave the
                page, you need to select "leave" to start the download.
                <br />
                <br />
                <img src="images/googleClassroom/image4.png" width="100%">
                <br />
                <br />
                <br />

                This will give you the zip file you can load into free math for grading, see
                the video on the Free Math homepage for a live demo of the grading experience.
                <br />
                <br />
                <img src="images/googleClassroom/image6.png" width="100%">
                <br />
                <br />
                <br />

                Once you finish grading, you will need to take the output file from Free Math,
                which is also a zip, and un-zip it locally into a folder. This is pretty
                straightforward on all platforms.
                <br />
                <br />

                On a Mac, simply double click on the zip file to unzip it.
                <br />
                <br />

                On Windows, right click on the file and select "Extract All" and follow
                the instructions.
                <br />
                <br />
                     
                On a Chrombook, open your file browser, navigate to the zip file and click
                on it to "mount" it. This will make it appear on the left-hand bar of the file
                browser similar to the experience of plugging in a USB drive. Note this must be
                done before you start the next step of actually uploading the files, if you do
                not mount it ahead of time you will not be able to select the individual files
                for uploading in the next step and it will just upload the whole zip file.
                <br />
                <br />

                Back on the google drive folder with your students' assignments, select "New"
                and then "File Upload".
                <br />
                <br />
                <img src="images/googleClassroom/image1.png" width="100%" />
                <br />
                <br />
                <br />

                This will open a File browser, navigate to the folder you created when you
                unzipped the graded documents (not the original zip you downloaded with the
                ungraded ones.) To quickly select all of the files, click on the first file
                in the folder, scroll to the bottom of the list and then hold shift while
                clicking the last file, this will select all files between the one previously
                selected and the one clicked.
                <br />
                <br />
                <img src="images/googleClassroom/image5.png" width="100%">
                <br />
                <br />
                <br />

                This warning will pop up when you submit the list of documents for uploading.
                The graded documents contain your students full work, along with your grades
                and comments. You can safely replace their original documents with your graded
                ones. They will be able to see your comments in context of their full work, and
                they can even make changes and re-submit the assignments for re-grading if desired.
                <br />
                <br />
                <img src="images/googleClassroom/image7.png" width="100%">

                <br />
                <br />
                We are still working on direct integrations with LMS gradebooks, so for now you will
                need to look at grades in Free Math using the "View Grades" button at the top of the
                grading page menu and manually copy over your students final grades.
